  Homebox is the inventory and organization system built for the Home User! 
  
  With a focus on simplicity and ease of use, Homebox is the perfect solution for your home inventory, organization, and management needs. 
  
  - Simple - Homebox is designed to be simple and easy to use. No complicated setup or configuration required. Use either a single docker container, or deploy yourself by compiling the binary for your platform of choice.
  
  - Blazingly Fast - Homebox is written in Go which makes it extremely fast and requires minimal resources to deploy. In general idle memory usage is less than 50MB for the whole container.
  
  - Portable - Homebox is designed to be portable and run on anywhere. We use SQLite and an embedded Web UI to make it easy to deploy, use, and backup.

  Setup: After installing Homebox, you will need to click the "Register" button to create your first account.
